# RU Direct

**RU Direct is no longer in active development. If you would like to take over RU Direct as its lead and update it to use the TransLoc API instead of the NextBus API, please contact us.**

## Description
RU Direct is a fast and intuitive Android app that helps you navigate the Rutgers University bus system. It displays what times buses are arriving at each bus stop, shows live-updating maps of each of the bus routes, and provides directions from one bus stop to another.
